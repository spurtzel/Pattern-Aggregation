## Scripts
- `event_sourced_network.py` includes the representation and generation of synthetic event networks.
    - Parameters: `sequence_length`, `network_size`, `event_skew`, and `event_node_ratio`

- `push_pull_aggregation_plan_generator.py` includes our `Cut & Compose` pattern-aggregation plan generator, cost models for `SEQ` and `AND`, and our network size experiment
    - Inputs: A pattern and an event network.
